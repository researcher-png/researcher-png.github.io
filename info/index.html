<h1>About LookItUpAsshat.com</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of your dumbass friends asking you dumbass questions online? Well now you don’t have to answer at all! Just send them this link and watch them discover the endless information on the internet!</p>
<h1>Why it exists tho?</h1>
    <p>LookItUpAsshat.com originally started as a fun little side project. I was bored one day and tired that my friends kept asking me dumb questions, so I made this website so I could send them the link and put them back in their place. Fun fact! It was originally called Google It, but unfortunately, I had to change the name for copyright reasons.</p>
